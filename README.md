# NewYorkSchoolsDemo

A sample android project to display New York schools data in a RecyclerView that is scrollable. The data is retieved in data layer 
using Retrofit library. The presentation layer is responsible to fetch and present it to the activity; thus, the Ux is not aware of the 
data and how it is fetched but simply displays the data. A partial unit test is included.
